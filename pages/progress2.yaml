    For the second Progress report, you are to begin work towards [Milestone 2],
    which involves designing and planning for your open source project.
    
    During this week, you should focus on the first few tasks:

    1. Identifying related work.

    2. Enumerating any necessary resources.

    3. Determining your technology stack.

    Given enough time, you should then focus on the remaining tasks:

    4. Outlining your architecture.

    5. Setting the goals for your MVP.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.  While you are not
    expected to have finalized all the details of your **design** choices, you
    should be able to describe some of your decisions and thoughts in regards
    to the topics above.
