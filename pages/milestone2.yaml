    Now that you have your project infrastructure setup and configured, you are
    now to begin the work of designing and planning your open source project.

    For the second **Milestone**, your group must accomplish the following tasks:

    1. **Related Work**: Identify any relevant related work (ie. existing
    projects, products, software, etc.).
        
        - Consider what you can take or learn from this related work.

        - Describe how your project is different for this related work.

    2. **Resources**: Enumerate any necessary hardware, software, or computing
    resources (ie. Raspberry Pis, cloud computing credits, software licenses,
    etc.).

    3. **Technology Stack**: Determine which set of technologies or platforms
    you will be using in your project (ie. programming language, libraries,
    development tools, etc.).

        - Explore these technologies to determine if they are viable or not.

        - Ensure all project members can develop with the chosen technology
          stack.

    4. **Architecture**: Outline the key architectural components of your
    project. 

        - Mock up the user interface of your project (if it requires one).  

        - Draw diagrams to illustrate the components of your software.

    5. **MVP**: Determine exactly what the end goal of the project should be.

        - Enumerate the absolute minimum set of realistic goals for the semester.

            - Break down these goals into discrete features or components.

            - Consider what tasks need to be done to implement these features.

        - Describe the ultimate set of aspirational goals given abundant time
          and resources.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Milestone**, your group must present the overall **project
    design** to the class and instructor.

    1. The group must upload their presentation slides to their project
    **Google Drive** folder.

    2. The group must be prepared to explain how their project is different
    from existing related work.

    3. The group must be prepared to illustrate the design of their project and
    to discuss the various components of the system.

    4. The group must be prepared to discuss both their realistic and
    aspirational goals for their project deliverable.
