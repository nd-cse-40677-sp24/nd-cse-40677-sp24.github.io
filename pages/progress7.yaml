    For the seventh Progress report, you are to gather feedback from your
    **public announcement** in [Milestone 4] and work with any new contributors
    and prepare for the debriefing in [Milestone 5].
    
    If you get feedback from any new users or contributions from outside
    developers, then you should try to incorporate that contribution into your
    project.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing the feedback you received from
    external users or contributors.  In particular, discuss the result of your
    **public announcement** in [Milestone 4] and what changes you are making
    based on that feedback.
