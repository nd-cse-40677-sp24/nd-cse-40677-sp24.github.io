    For the sixth Progress report, you are to prepare for your public
    announcement as specified in [Milestone 4].
    
    During this week, you begin planning your short video that provides an
    overview of your project, its goals, its features, and your contributions.
    Moreover, you consider updating your website to highlight this information.

    Likewise, you should produce packaging and documentation for end users who
    wish to download and utilize your software (not necessarily build it and
    contribute code).  Again, this may require investigating operating system
    or language specific package management systems.

    By the end of this sprint, you should be ready to make your public
    announcement.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing on the content and structure of
    your announcement (what do you want to highlight and what story do you wish
    to tell to users).  Likewise, provide an overview of how you expect end
    users to utilize your software artifact.  Finally, discuss where you plan
    on making your public announcement.  If there is some work left to be done
    on the prototype, briefly highlight the remaining obstacles and your plans
    for them as well.
