    For the third Progress report, you are to begin work towards [Milestone 3],
    which involves implementing your initial **prototype**.
    
    During this week, you should focus on ensuring everyone in the group can
    contribute technically to the project and then begin dividing up the
    features or architectual components to different group members.

    Remember, that the idea behind the open source software development model
    is to make small incremental changes that get integrated into the larger
    project.  Break down your features and components into smaller individual
    tasks and then iterate on those more concise goals.

    By the end of this sprint, you should have a **software artifact that
    builds** and is **usable by everyone in the group**.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing your use of the project
    infrastructure, the division of labor, and the core components of your
    project.
