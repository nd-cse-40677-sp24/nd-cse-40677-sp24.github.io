    For the fourth Progress report, you are to continue working towards
    [Milestone 3], which involves implementing your initial **prototype**.
    
    During this week, you should focus on completing core features of
    components of your software architecture. Additionally, you should assess
    the choices you have made in [Milestone 2] regarding **related work**,
    **resources**, **technology stack**, and **architecture** and determine if
    adjustments need to be made.

    By the end of this sprint, you should have a software artifact that
    functions with a basic set of features you identified in [Milestone 2].

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing the technical and workflow
    challenges you have faced and what decisions you have made to overcome
    these obstacles.  Likewise, describe the progress you have made towards a
    working **prototype**.
