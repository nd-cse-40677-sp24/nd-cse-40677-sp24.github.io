    For the fifth Progress report, you are to begin work towards [Milestone 4],
    which involves announcing your project to the public.
    
    During this week, you should focus solidifying your developer and
    contributor documentation.  Make sure that any that your repository has a
    clear guide on how to build, install, or deploy your software.  This means
    that you may need to look into language or operating system specific
    package managers or dependency systems.

    Additionally, you should continue addressing any remaining incomplete
    features or bugs left in your initial prototype.  While you want to cover
    as many of the goals set out earlier in the semester, your true goal is
    ensure the project has the necessary infrastructure for future development.

    By the end of this sprint, you should have a software artifact that builds
    and is usable by anyone.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing on the developer and
    contribution documentation you have written.  Likewise, provide an overview
    of what it would take to setup a developer environment for someone who
    wants to contribute to your project.  Additionally, investigate using
    language or operating system specific package managers or containerization
    systems.  Finally, provide a brief update on any new features or fixes with
    your prototype.
