    Now that you have experienced setting up, building, and releasing an open
    source project, you are to reflect on the experience in a **debriefing**
    presentation.

    For the fifth **Milestone**, your group must accomplish the following
    tasks:

    1. **Prototype**: Complete the remaining goals you set out for your
    **minimum viable product** (as discussed in [Milestone 2]).

    2. **Contributions**: Triage and shepherd any outside contributions or
    feedback received from your **public announcement** in [Milestone 4]).

    3. **Debriefing**: Make a presentation that summarizes what you learned
    from this experience in open source software development:

        - What are the challenges to open source software development?

        - What are the benefits of open source software development?

        - How is this process different from what you have done in other
          classes or at internships?

        - Do you plan on continuing the work on your project?

        - Do you plan on contributing to other open source projects?

    ### Deliverables

    For this **Milestone**, your group must provide a **debriefing** about
    their open source software development experience with the class and
    instructor.

    1. The group must upload their presentation slides to their project
    **Google Drive** folder.

    2. The group must triage and integrate reasonable feedback and
    contributions from external developers and users.

    3. The group must provide an update of the final state of their software
    artifact.

    4. The group must discuss their future plans.
