    For the first **Progress Report**, you are to work towards [Milestone 1]
    by determining what **infrastructure** and **organization** do you wish to
    utilize throughout the semester.  To help you in this process, consider the
    following questions:

    1. Do you have a **project name**?

    2. Do you have a **web presence**?

        - Who has experience with web development?

        - What platform or tools will you be using for this?

    3. Do you have a **code repository**?

        - Who has control or access to your project(s)?

        - Who has adminstrative (ie. merge) permissions?

        - What is your development workflow (branches, approvals, etc)?

        - How will you test or verify that your project works?

    4. What **communal development** tools or services are you considering?

        - Are there any obstacles or challenges preventing you from using or
          adopting these tools or services?

        - What are your experiences with these tools or services?

    5. Which **open source licenses** are you considering?

        - Do any of the tools, frameworks, or libraries you are considering
          impact your decision?

    ### Deliverables

    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.  While you are not
    expected to have finalized all the details of your **infrastructure**
    choices, you should be able to describe some of your decisions and thoughts
    in regards to the questions above.
