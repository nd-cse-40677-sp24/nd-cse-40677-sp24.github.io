    For the eighth Progress report, you are to continue gathering feedback from
    your **public announcement** in [Milestone 4] and working with any new
    contributors and prepare for the debriefing in [Milestone 5].
    
    Additionally, you should put any finishing touches required to meet the
    goals you set out in [Milestone 2] for your **MVP**.

    ### Deliverables
    
    For this **Progress Report**, your group must upload their presentation
    slides to the group's project **Google Drive** folder.

    Your group should provide evidence of your work by using their issues or
    project management tools, working on the project repository, and
    communicating via their group chat.

    For this presentation, focus on discussing how you are incorporating
    outside contributions and what you are learning from this process.
    Likewise, discuss what remaining tasks your group has for meeting the goals
    of your **MVP**.
