    As discussed in our first meeting, each project must meet **five**
    **Project Requirements**.  Most of these **Requirements** involve the use
    of certain technical **infrastructure** such as web hosting, public code
    repositories, communications channels, and automated services as part of
    the development process.

    For the first **Milestone**, your group must investigate the various
    options for these services and then settle on the preliminary technical
    **infrastructure** for the project:

    1. How will you maintain a **web presence**?

    2. Where will you host your **code repository**?

    3. What **communal development** tools or services will your project
    employ?

        a. What is your **project / issue board**?

        b. Will you have a **wiki**?

        c. What is your **bug / issue tracker**?

        d. How will you provide real-time communication (ie. **chat**)?

    4. What is the overall **approval** process for accepting new contributions
    to the project?

        a. How will you perform **code review**?

        b. How will you **test** your project?

        c. How will you **deploy** your project?

    5. Which **open source license** will you use for your project?

    ### Deliverables

    For this **Milestone**, your group must present the chosen
    **infrastructure** for the project to the class and instructor.

    1. The group must upload their presentation slides to their project
    **Google Drive** folder.

    2. The group must be prepared to explain their choice of tooling, services,
    and license.

    3. The group must be prepared to demonstrate the functionality of each
    infrastructure component (ie. how they work).
