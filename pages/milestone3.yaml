    Now that you have a general design and plan for your project, you are now
    to work on the initial **prototype** of your project.

    For the third **Milestone**, your group must accomplish the following tasks:

    1. **Prototype**: Build the initial version of your **minimum viable
    product**.  Although it does not need be feature complete, it must have the
    following properties:

        - Have technical contributions from all group members.

        - Is usable by all group members.

        - Implement a majority of the goals or features identified in [Milestone 2].

    2. **Process**: Continue using the infrastructure configured and setup from
    [Milestone 1]. This means that you should be doing the following:

        - Identifying tasks on your issue or project trackers and making
          progress on them.

        - Contributing to your project's code repository.

        - Filing issues or bug reports as necessary.

        - Communicating via your group's chosen communication channels.

    3. **Reflection**: Consider any adjustments that need to be made as you
    make progress towards your initial **prototype**:

        - Is there newly discovered **related work** that impacts your project?

        - Do you need more or different **resources**?

        - Is the **technology stack** you have chosen sufficient or will you
          need to make changes?

        - What changes (if any) to your **architecture** are necessary?

        - Will you need to reconsider some of your goals for the **MVP**?

    As you work towards the **prototype**, you should be following the open
    source software development model of constant **iteration**.  It may be
    useful to appoint one person as a **gatekeeper** of sorts to integrate and
    coordinate the changes from different developers.  The exact management and
    organization of the project is up to you, however.

    ### Deliverables

    For this **Milestone**, your group must demonstrate the initial
    **prototype** to the class and instructor.

    1. The group must upload their presentation slides to their project
    **Google Drive** folder.

    2. The group must update their website to include an announcement about the
    progress they have made towards their **prototype**.  This should include
    **screenshots**, **screencasts**, or **videos** demonstrating the
    functionality and features of the **prototype**.

    3. The group must continue to use their project **issues/project management
    tools** to keep track of the tasks above and assign them to different
    members of the group.  Each person should have ownership of a task, though
    anyone can contribute.  The exact management of the workflow is left up to
    the group.

    4. The group must summarize the work they did for this milestone and
    enumerate the **contributions of each member**.

    5. The group should be able to **identify any unresolved issues or
    obstacles** and to describe the decisions they made.
