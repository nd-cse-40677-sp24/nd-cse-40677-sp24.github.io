<p>Now that you have a general design and plan for your project, you are now
to work on the initial <strong>prototype</strong> of your project.</p>
<p>For the third <strong>Milestone</strong>, your group must accomplish the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Prototype</strong>: Build the initial version of your <strong>minimum viable
product</strong>.  Although it does not need be feature complete, it must have the
following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have technical contributions from all group members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is usable by all group members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a majority of the goals or features identified in <a href="milestone2.html">Milestone 2</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Process</strong>: Continue using the infrastructure configured and setup from
<a href="milestone1.html">Milestone 1</a>. This means that you should be doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identifying tasks on your issue or project trackers and making
  progress on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contributing to your project's code repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filing issues or bug reports as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communicating via your group's chosen communication channels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong>: Consider any adjustments that need to be made as you
make progress towards your initial <strong>prototype</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there newly discovered <strong>related work</strong> that impacts your project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need more or different <strong>resources</strong>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the <strong>technology stack</strong> you have chosen sufficient or will you
  need to make changes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What changes (if any) to your <strong>architecture</strong> are necessary?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you need to reconsider some of your goals for the <strong>MVP</strong>?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you work towards the <strong>prototype</strong>, you should be following the open
source software development model of constant <strong>iteration</strong>.  It may be
useful to appoint one person as a <strong>gatekeeper</strong> of sorts to integrate and
coordinate the changes from different developers.  The exact management and
organization of the project is up to you, however.</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables<a class="headerlink" href="#deliverables" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For this <strong>Milestone</strong>, your group must demonstrate the initial
<strong>prototype</strong> to the class and instructor via <strong>5 minute video</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The group must upload their <strike>presentation slides</strike> video
to their project <strong>Google Drive</strong> folder (<em>video may be embedded in a slide
deck if necessary</em>) by <strong>midnight, Friday, March 8</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group must update their website to include an announcement about the
progress they have made towards their <strong>prototype</strong>.  This should include
<strong>screenshots</strong>, <strong>screencasts</strong>, or <strong>videos</strong> demonstrating the
functionality and features of the <strong>prototype</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group must continue to use their project <strong>issues/project management
tools</strong> to keep track of the tasks above and assign them to different
members of the group.  Each person should have ownership of a task, though
anyone can contribute.  The exact management of the workflow is left up to
the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group must summarize the work they did for this milestone and
enumerate the <strong>contributions of each member</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group should be able to <strong>identify any unresolved issues or
obstacles</strong> and to describe the decisions they made.</p>
</li>
</ol>
